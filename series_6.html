       <p class="text-justify ">Talking about the exempted persons, this refers to those set of persons who are, in one way or the other, exempted from fasting in the month of Romadon. They are people that, by virtue of their status or circumstancial considerations, are required to perform another act, in substitute of fasting in the month of Romadon. The rationale in their exclusion in this regard is in order to ameliorate the hardship that fasting during this period would cause them. </p>
       <p class="text-justify "> They are people who are allowed either to fast back at later time or to have another rite done as the case may be as it is clearly established in the Qur-aan, the Sunnah of the prophet of Islam (S.A.W) and agreed upon by Islamic scholars.</p>
          
          <h3 class="h4 text-dark text-capitalize mt-4"> The exempted persons</h3>
          <p class="text-justify"> As stated and explain in the book 'sohiih fiq-hus-sunnah', there are about three categories of persons exempted from participating in the fast of Romadon, vis-a-vis: </p>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3"> A. Those who are PERMITTED not to fast but to have it paid back at later time or otherwise. </p>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3"> B. Those who are MANDATED not to fast and to have it paid back only. </p>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3">C. Those who are not elegible to have the fast paid back nor feed poor person. </p>
          
          <h3 class="h5 text-dark text-capitalize mt-4"> the discussion </h3>
          <h5 class="h6 text-center text-capitalize text-info"> <span class="text-info">A.</span> Those who are PERMITTED not to fast and to have it paid back at later time or otherwise. </h5>
          
          <h6 class="text-justify text-capitalize">1. The sick:  </h6>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3"> This comprises of those who are sick and as a result, lacks the ability to fast or continue the fast for a quite number of days. Where the sickness is just a very slight one (like a slight headache, catarrh, cold etc), one is not disallowed to fast. But, in a situation where the sickness persists and the concerned person finds it very difficult to continue with the fast, he is allowed to discontinue with the fasting till he feels better and thus, required to make up the missed days later. Evidence for this is contained in Q2 vs 184. </p>
          
          <h6 class="text-justify text-capitalize">2. The traveller:  </h6>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3"> Travelling is moving out of a city to another. A traveller is also permitted to skip Romadon fast during the course of his journey. He has the sole discretion to either fast or choose not to. However, provided the journey does not bring any hardship or so, it is recommended that fasting is the best (see Q2 vs 184). But, if fasting while on the journey will cause him hardship, he is required to suspend the fast and while he makes up the missed days at later date. </p>
          
          <h6 class="text-justify text-capitalize">3. The aged:  </h6>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3"> Those who have attained old-age and who have not, the capacity to fast are also exempted from fasting. They are expected to feed a poor person daily throughout the month of Romadon.  </p>
          
          <h6 class="text-justify text-capitalize">4. The pregnant:  </h6>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3"> They are also exempted only if fasting is going to cause them harm. There are various scholarly opinions regarding the payment of fast missed by the pregnant who are incapacitated to fast during Romadon. However, the most outweiging of the five opinions held is that: based on the HADIITH reported by ibn `Abbaas, those in this category are required to do as the aged persons, i.e feeding a poor person daily throughout the month and with no need of paying back.</p>
         
          <h6 class="text-justify text-capitalize">5. The breastfeeding Women:  </h6>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3">The rule is the same as that of the pregnant already captured above.</p>
          
          <h6 class="text-justify text-capitalize">6. persistent sickness:  </h6>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3">Those affected with persistent sickness are also allowed to have their fast break. Like that of breastfeeding women, aged persons and the pregnant, they are to feed a poor person daily.</p>
          
          
          <h5 class="h6 text-center text-capitalize text-info"> <span class="text-info">B.</span> those who are mandated to have their fast break while they pay back the missed days at later time. </h5>
          
          <h6 class="text-justify text-capitalize">1. Women having their menstrual course (Al-Hayd): </h6>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3">Women of this category are expected and mandated not to attempt fasting and meanwhile, they are required to pay the missee number back at later time. </p>
          
          <h6 class="text-justify text-capitalize">2. Women experiencing the blood flow after post-childbirth (An-Nifaas):</h6>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3">The Islamic ruling is also the same as those in their monthly period. They are disallowed to make an attempt to fast during the period of the blood flow. </p>
          
          <h6 class="text-justify text-capitalize">3. He who cares for his life:</h6>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3">For he who cares for his life, he is strongly required to skip fasting and that, he, at later time, make up the missed days. </p>
          
          <h5 class="h6 text-center text-capitalize text-info"> <span class="text-info">C.</span> those who are not elegible to Pay Back At Later Time Nor Feed poor person</h5>
          <p class="text-justify mb-1">Those in this category are those who have no right to skip fasting during the month of Romadon and they include those who satisfy these criteria:  </p>
          <ul class="ml-4 text-justify ">
            <li class="">That they are Muslim;</li>
            <li class="">That they have attained puberty stage;</li>
            <li class="">That they are sane;</li>
            <li class="">That they are healthy and not otherwise;</li>
            <li class="">That they are resident and not traveller, and</li>
            <li class="">Women who are free from Hayd (monthly flow) and Nifaas (post-childbirth blood flow).</li>
