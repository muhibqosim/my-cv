       <article class="text-dark text-justify "> 
         <p class=""> According to Al-Maqrizi, inflation could be a natural cause or due to human error  such as hoarding, exploitation etc. Price control as a tool for curbing the spread of inflation has been adequately discussed in the preceding section. However, the Sharii`ah (the comprehensive Islamic law or code) extends its juristic view to the problem of inflation, and the effectivity of price control in the circumstance. Hence, at this juncture, the Islamic view shall be given much attention</p>
       </article>
       <article class="text-dark text-justify mt-2"> 
         <p> The issue of price control is not a novel case. It has stemmed even during the lifetime of the prophet (saw). Then, it happens that there was an increase in the normal price of commodities in the market. So, the people approached him (saw) to intervene in the circumstance. This was reported in one of his traditions by Abu Dawud:</p>
         <p class="mx-3 text-secondary text-italize"> The people said to Prophet of Allah: prices have shot up, so fix prices for us. Thereupon, the Apostle of Allah said Allah is the one. Who fixes prices, who withholds, give lavishly and provides, and I hope that when I meet Allah, none of you will have any claim on me for an injustice regarding blood or property</p>
         <p class=""> It is based on this authority that Islamic jurists opined their brilliant opinions on the fixation of price otherwise known as price control policy. Their juristic opinions and verdicts on the subject matter in the tackle of inflationary problem could be summarized into two ‚Äì permissible intervention and non-permissible intervention.</p>
         <p class="">Although, the majority opinion of Islamic scholars is that price fixation is haroom (prohibited) ‚Äì being the general rule.  Notwithstanding, it is a trite Islamic principle that ‚Äúfor every general rule, there is an exception (likulli qoo`idatin, is-tith-naa')‚Äù. However, it may not be so in all cases. </p>
         <p class="">On the non-permissibility of price fixation, it is held that fixing price where the increase in prices of commodities is based on natural causes is illegitimate. The intervention of the government or any authority in the fixation of prices, in such instances, is disallowed. It was reached that, relying on the Prophetic tradition above and other related traditions, such intervention would result in the breach of individual‚Äôs right to sell his goods and services at a price he so wishes. </p>
         <p class="">The second opinion being the permissibility to enforce price control policy is based on ijtihaad (juristic inference). The jurist further expound their view, through ijtihaad, on the above-cited authority. They hereby came up with the following analysis. They said, injustice of traders is the base of price control. That the prophet (saw) declined the request of the people to fix the market prices was only that the increase in prices was not due to illegal acts of traders. It was by nature. Hence, the hadiith does not prohibit the government action in fixing a just market price when the situation does warrant. They further said, when rise in prices occurs because of hoarding, motive to exploit the buyers, profiteering and so on, it is permissible that the government or any authority in charge intervene. In fact, among them said, intervention at that very particular time is not only permissible but obligatory. They further support their view with the action of the second caliph of Islam, `Umar ibn Khottoob, during his tenure when similar thing happened and other prophetic traditions.  However, before the implementation of price control policy, certain requirements must be fulfilled.</p>
         <p class="">The jurist, after expressing their brilliant juristic view on price fixation policy further went on providing guidelines and requirements to be satisfied before embarking on such policy. The guidelines is to confine the government within their limit. Just price control policy only aims at keeping balances in the prices of goods and preventing oppression with both the seller and the buyer. They are:
           <ol class="mx-4" style="">
             <li>Government or the authorities should summon to a meeting all parties to price negotiation. This includes the traders' and the buyers‚Äô representatives as well as, other experts.</li>
             <li>Each representatives‚Äô opinions should be sought and assessment made on the rates at which they buy and sell in the market.</li>
             <li>An agreement should be reached on prices that are beneficial to both parties, the sellers and the buyers. However the acceptance should be without coercion.</li>
       </ol>  </p>
         <p class="">Based on the foregoing, Sharii`ah demands that cases of market failure [such as inflation] should be critically examined if they qualify for intervention.  </p>

       <article class="text-dark text-justify "> 
         <p> <b class="text-uppercase"> By way of conclusion,</b> price control has been one of the widely used instruments in curbing the spread of inflation globally. In fact, both the Islamic and the conventional economics out-and-out examined imperfections in the market with the conclusion that in such cases, just price fixation is necessary. As such, it is imperative that the Sharii`ah provisions on Price control policy be employed and promoted in facing inflationary problem by the Price Control Board  to create an enabling environment between the buyers and the sellers. </p>
