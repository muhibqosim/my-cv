          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase mt-4">introduction:</h3>
          <p class="text-justify ">Coming to the end of "few days to Romadon series" and being the seventh one, we shall be discussing another important aspect to know about fasting in islaam. </p>
          <p class="text-justify ">As couched in the topic, the Islamic ruling regulating the payment of Romadoon missed fast are built on some certain number of principles. Thus, this writing shall discuss the various Islamic rulings on making up of Romadoon missed fast - when and how. </p>
          
          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase mt-4"> PAYING BACK THE MISSED FAST:</h3>
          <p class="text-justify"> This applies to those who are allowed to skip fasting in the month of Romadon as it was fully covered in the series 6 of few days to Romadon. The islamic ruling guiding the make up of the missed fast are thus discussed below: </p>
          
          <h5 class="h6 text-center text-uppercase "> <span class="text-info text-uppercase h5">PRINCIPLE ONE:</span> <br /> He who skips his fast or have it break without having a genuine reason have to make it up </h5>
          <p class="text-justify"> Although, scholars are of two opinions in this regards, the strong opinion is that, only the missed days should be paid back only and nothing else.  </p>
          
          <h5 class="h6 text-center text-uppercase "> <span class="text-info text-uppercase h5">PRINCIPLE two:</span> <br /> It is not a mandate to make up the missed days immediately after the Romadon fasting period </h5>
          <p class="text-justify"> That is, he who have his fast break, without any legal justification, is not under force to have the make-up immediately after the completion of Romadon. He has the freewill to determine when  to have it paid back.</p>
          
          <h5 class="h6 text-center text-uppercase "> <span class="text-info text-uppercase h5">PRINCIPLE three:</span> <br /> Persons under obligation to have the Romadon missed fast paid back are not compelled to do that successively</h5>
          <p class="text-justify"> Somehow related to principle two discussed above, this principle is making it clear that no one is under compel to have the missed fast paid back consecutively without break; it is by discretion. Thus, the clear distinction between  the second principle and third principle is that while the former is as to "when" to have them paid back, the later is as to "how" they should be mad.</p>
          
          <h5 class="h6 text-center text-uppercase "> <span class="text-info text-uppercase h5">PRINCIPLE four:</span> <br /> Making up the missed fast of a decease.</h5>
          <p class="text-justify mb-0"> Whether it is right or not to fast on behalf of a deceased person, there are three scholarly opinions regarding the permissibility or otherwise. They are: </p>
          
          <p class="text-justify font-italic mx-2 mb-0"> a. That no fast should be made on behalf of a deceased person, be it the decease missed Romadoon fast or his self-obligatory by way of vow (nadh-r), which he had made before death overpowered him. </p>
          <p class="text-justify font-italic mx-2 mb-0">b. That it is legal, right and required to fast on behalf of a decease person be it missed Romadoon fast or self-obligatory by way of vow (nadh-r). </p>
          <p class="text-justify font-italic mx-2 ">c. That only the 'self-obligatory fast' should be made on behalf of the decease and not the missed Romadon fast. </p>
           <p class="text-justify "> It should be noted that each of these opinions are backed with relevant authorities. However, the author of sohiih fiq-hus-sunnah  adopted and stood by the opinion of the second group of scholars who were of the opinion that both the missed fast of Romadon and that of vow should be made on behalf of the deceased. </p>
           
           <p class="text-justify text-secondary"> Meanwhile, there are still some conditions that influence such a permission, viz: </p>
          <p class="text-justify font-italic mx-2 ">1. Where it is proved that  the decease, when he was alive, lacked the capacity and ability to make up his fast be it Romadon or Self-obligatory fast, his relative and heirs are not mandated to far on behalf of him nor are they compelled to feed sixty poor persons or to have a slave freed. </p>
          <p class="text-justify font-italic mx-2 ">2. Where it is proved that  the decease, when he was alive, lacked the capacity and ability to make up his fast be it Romadon or Self-obligatory fast, his relative and heirs are not mandated to far on behalf of him nor are they compelled to feed sixty poor persons or to have a slave freed. </p>
          <p class="text-justify font-italic mx-2 ">3. And if he died having an outstanding Self-obligatory fast, it should be made on behalf of him. . </p>

          <p class="text-justify ">Talking about the exempted persons, this refers to those set of persons who are, in one way or the other, exempted from fasting in the month of Romadon. They are people that, by virtue of their status or circumstancial considerations, were required to perform another act, instead of fasting in the month of Romadon, in order to ameliorate the hardship of fasting during this period. </p>
          <p class="text-justify "> They are people who are allowed either to fast back at later time or to have another rite done as the case may be as it was established in the Qur-aan, the Sunnah of the prophet of Islam (S.A.W) and agreed upon by Islamic scholars.</p>
          
          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase mt-4"> THE EXEMPTED PERSONS:</h3>
          <p class="text-justify"> As stated and explain in the book, sohiih fiq-hus-sunnah, there are about three categories of persons exempted from participating in the fast of Romadon, vis-a-vis: </p>

          <p class="text-justify"> B. Those who are MANDATED not to fast and to have it paid back only. </p>
          <p class="text-justify">C. Those who are not legible to have the fast paid back nor feed poor person. </p>

          <h5 class="h6 text-center text-uppercase text-info"> <span class="text-info">A.</span> Those who are PERMITTED not to fast and to have it paid back at later time or otherwise. </h5>
          
          <h6 class="text-justify text-uppercase">1. The sick:  </h6>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3"> This comprises of those who are sick and as a result, lacks the ability to fast or continue the fast for a quite number of days. Where the sickness is just a very slight one (like a slight headache, catarrh, cold etc), one is not allowed not to fast. But, in a situation where the sickness persists and the concerned person finds it very difficult to continue with the fast, he is allowed to discontinue with the fast till he feels better and make up the missed days later. Evidence for this is contained in Q2 vs 184. </p>
          
          <h6 class="text-justify text-uppercase">2. The traveller:  </h6>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3"> TTravelling is moving out of a city to another. A traveller is also permitted to skip Romadon fast during the course of his journey. He has the sole discretion to either fast or choose not to. However, provided the journey does not bring any hardship or so, it is recommended that fasting is the best. See Q2 vs 184. But, if fasting while on the journey will cause him grievous hardship, he is required to suspend the fast and while he make up the missed days later. </p>
          
          <h6 class="text-justify text-uppercase">3. The aged:  </h6>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3"> Those who have attained old-age and who have not, the capacity to fast are also exempted from fasting. They are expected to feed a poor person daily throughout the month of Romadon.  </p>
          
          <h6 class="text-justify text-uppercase">4. The pregnant:  </h6>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3"> They are also exempted only if fasting is going to cause them harm. There are various scholarly opinions regarding the payment of fast missed by the pregnant who are incapacitated to fast during Romadon. However, the most outweiging of the five opinions held is that: based on the HADIITH reported by ibn `Abbaas, those in this category are required to do as the Aged, i.e feeding a poor person daily throughout the month and with no need of paying back.</p>
         
          <h6 class="text-justify text-uppercase">5. The breastfeeding Women:  </h6>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3">The rule is the same as that of the pregnant.</p>
          
          <h6 class="text-justify text-uppercase">6. persistent sickness:  </h6>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3">Those affected with persistent sickness are also allowed to have their fast break. Like that of breastfeeding women, aged persons and the pregnant, they are to feed a poor person daily.</p>
          
          
          <h5 class="h6 text-center text-uppercase text-info"> <span class="text-info">B.</span> THOSE WHO ARE MANDATED TO HAVE THEIR FAST BREAK WHILE THEY PAY BACK THE MISSED DAYS AT LATER TIME. </h5>
          
          <h6 class="text-justify text-uppercase">1. Women having their menstrual course: </h6>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3">Women of this category are expected and mandated not to attempt fasting and meanwhile, they are required to pay back at later time. </p>
          
          <h6 class="text-justify text-uppercase">2. Women experiencing the blood flow after post-childbirth:</h6>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3">The Islamic ruling is also the same as those in their monthly period. They are disallowed to make an That no fasting on behalf of a deceased person be it missed Romadoon fast or self-obligatory by way of vow (nadh-r) to fast. </p>
          
          <h6 class="text-justify text-uppercase">3. He who cares for his life:</h6>
          <p class="text-justify ml-3">For he who cares for his life, there is permissibility for him to skip fasting and That no fasting on behalf of a deceased person be it missed Romadoon fast or self-obligatory by way of vow (nadh-r) them paid back at subsequent time. </p>
          
          <h5 class="h6 text-center text-uppercase text-info"> <span class="text-info">C.</span> C. THOSE WHO ARE NOT LEGIBLE TO PAY BACK AT LATER TIME NOR FEED POOR PERSON</h5>

          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase mt-4"> The non-nullifiers: </h3>
          <p class="text-justify"> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> 1. Bathing during the day: </span>Bathing does not invalidate the fast.  </p>
        
          <p class="text-justify"> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> 2. Tasting the food: </span>Tasting food, if there is strong reason to do that, does not invalidate the fast unless the substance passes through the throat.    </p>
         
          <p class="text-justify"><span class="font-italic font-weight-bold"> 3. Rinsing the mouth: </span> It is permissible and not of the invalidators. However, it must be done with precaution and lightly. The water must not pass through the throat.  </p>
          
          <p class="text-justify mb-0"> <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold"> 4. Cupping and blood transfusion:</span> The consensus opinion is that cupping and blood transfusion are both not invalidators of ṣowm (fast). Nevertheless, it was held that:  </p>
          <ul class="ml-4 text-justify ">
            <li class=""> it is disliked if the person undergoing cupping and the person undergoing blood transfusion would be affected. And also that,  </li>
            <li class="">it is not accepted to undergo any of it provided the person will be prompted to have the fast break. That is, it is at best if it could be done after the fast breaking time. Allaah knows best. </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p class="text-justify"> <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold"> 5. Applying eye drop: </span> If for health purposes, one is compelled to apply eye drop, there is no problem with that.   </p>
         
          <p class="text-justify"> <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold"> 6. Taking Injection: </span> Taking Injection that is not nutritive during the fasting period does not invalidate the fast. However, for those having their nutrition through injection, as contained in sohiih fiq-hus-sunnah, whether or not such injection contains nutritive substances, it does not nullify their fast. </p>
         
          <p class="text-justify"><span class="font-italic font-weight-bold"> 7. Brushing the teeth: </span> This act does not also invalidate the fast. Notwithstanding, the Shaafi`iyyah and the Hambaliyyah are still of the opinion of suspending the use of brush till after iftoor (fast breaking time). However, they did not say it invalidates the fast. </p>
          
          <p class="text-justify ">  <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">8. The extraction of mucus: </span> Mucus coming out of the nostrils does not render the fast in annulment. </p>
          
          <p class="text-justify ">  <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">9. Unintentional eating, drinking and vomiting: </span> Based on the Hadiith reported from the prophet, eating or drinking unconsciously does not invalidates the fast. However, if one persists and continue eating, even if it is just a mouthful, after he has recollected that he is fasting, then, he has to pay back that day. In the same vein, vomiting, unintentionally, has no effect on the fast. </p>
         
          <p class="text-justify mb-1"> <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">10. Being in state of junub (i.e impurity): </span>Impurity, in this context, is that liquid discharge that comes out from either of the two genders' organs be it: through copulation or as a result of "casting a look" on one's spouse or having a wet dream.</p>
          <p class="text-justify mb-1"> Relying on the hadiith reported by Imaam Bukoriyy, if someone get discharge after casting a  look on his wife, his fast is still intact.</p>
          <p class="text-justify mb-1"> Also, he who gets up in the morning being in state of janabah after having affairs with his wife the previous night should just take his ritual bath and continue his fast. </p>
          <p class="text-justify "> And as for he who had a wet dream, unless the discharge is through masturbation or that he himself is the cause of the discharge, such does not nullify his fast. So also, the females. </p>
          
          <p class="text-justifyk."> These are some of the non-invalidators of ṣowm (fasting). Only Him knows best. </p>

          <p class="text-justify ">Talking about Invalidators of fasting in Islaam, we are talking about those acts that will render our fast in annulment, if done. It is very important to know all these nullifiers of ṣowm (fasting) which shall be discussed subsequently. </p>
          
          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase">what are the nullifiers of ṣowm?</h3>
          <p class="text-justify mb-0"> The question as to what are the nullifiers or invalidators of Ṣowm could best be answered under two headings:  </p>
          <ol class="ml-4 text-justify ">
            <li class="">Invalidators which require paying back only, and  </li>
            <li class="">Invalidators which require paying back and making of atonement. </li>
          </ol>
          
          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase">the discussion</h3>
          <h5 class="h5 text-uppercase text-left mt-2">1. Invalidators which require paying back only (Al-Qodoo'):</h5>
          <p class="text-justify">This comprises those nullifiers upon which a fasting person is required and mandated to make up the fast at later date. This requires the victim, whose Romadon fast was annulled, to have the annulled fast paid back after the month of Romadon has elapsed. Nullifiers and Invalidators under this heading includes the following: </p>
          <ul class="ml-4 text-justify font-italic">
            <li class="">Intentional passage of food and/or drink into the stomach, and not out of nisyaan (forgetfulness). </li>
            <li class="">Vomiting intentionally.</li>
            <li class="">Coming out of menstrual flow or that of post-childbirth, even for a minute before the sun set.</li>
            <li class="">Masturbation and coming out of al-maniyy (sperm), intentionally and without forgetfulness.</li>
            <li class="">Having the intention of breaking the fast before the sunset. </li>
            <li class="">Denouncing the religion of Islaam before the time of if-toor (fast breaking). And provided he, at later time, refuted his initial declaration and thus, returned back to the religion of Islaam, he has to make up that particular annulled fast back. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">NOTE:</span> If any of these, by any circumstance, happened, the affected days are to be made-up after the end of Romadon. </p>
          
          
          <h5 class="h5 text-uppercase text-left mt-2">2. Invalidators which require paying back and making of atonement (Al-qodoo' wal-kaffaaroh):</h5>
          <p class="text-justify">Under this, there is only one nullifier: 'Having sexual relation' during Romadon fast. The hadiith provided below is so well instructive. Read:</p>
          <p class="text-justify mx-2 font-weight-bold font-italic"> "Narrated Abu Huraira: While we were sitting with the Prophet (ﷺ) a man came and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have been ruined." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked what was the matter with him. He replied "I had sexual intercourse with my wife while I was fasting." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked him, "Can you afford to manumit (free) a slave?" He replied in the negative. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked him, "Can you fast for two successive months?" He replied in the negative. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked him, "Can you afford to feed sixty poor persons?" He replied in the negative. The Prophet (ﷺ) kept silent and while we were in that state, a big basket full of dates was brought to the Prophet (ﷺ) . He asked, "Where is the questioner?" He replied, "I (am here)." The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), "Take this (basket of dates) and give it in charity." The man said, "Should I give it to a person poorer than I? By Allah; there is no family between its (i.e. Medina's) two mountains who are poorer than I." The Prophet (ﷺ) smiled till his premolar teeth became visible and then said, 'Feed your family with it." (Reported by Bukoriy).</p>
          <p class="text-justify"> Behold! It is still subject of contention among Islamic jurists, as to whether a victim of this is required to pay back the affected day in addition to the stipulated atonement as clearly stated in the prophetic saying above. </p>
          <p class="text-justify"> However, the outweighing opinion is that, only the atonement is required. Allaah knows best.  </p>

          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase mt-4">introduction:</h3>
          <p class="text-justify ">The topic, "with what does the Romadon fast become compulsory", could best understood as, determinants or considerable factors that influence the fasting period in the month of Romadon. </p>
          <p class="text-justify ">As such, this write-up will briefly and summarily  address those factors responsible for determining 'when and way' to commence fasting in the blessed month. </p>
          
          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase">FACTORS INFLUENCING ROMADON FAST:</h3>
          <p class="text-justify"> According to the author of Sohiih Fiq-hus-sunnah, 'sighting of the moon' is the only the factor influencing fasting period in Romadon. By sighting of the moon, it is meant that, seeing or witnessing the new moon of the month of Romadon. </p>
          <p class="text-justify mb-0">  The commencement of the month of Romadon could be determined via any of these two ways: </p>
          <ol class="ml-4 text-justify mb-1">
            <li class="">Seeing the new cresent, and </li>
            <li class="">Completion of Sha`ban.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="text-justify">These two highlighted factors shall be further discussed as below: </p>
          <h5 class="h5 text-uppercase text-left mt-2">1. Seeing the New Cresent:</h5>
          <p class="text-justify"> This is saying that, before the commencement of Romadon can be declared or determined, the new moon of Romadon must be sighted. This is predicated on the saying of Allah: <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold"> "...So, whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it;..." (Al-Baqorah 2:185) </span> </p>
          <p class="text-justify"> Also, going by the sayings of the prophet, in the book of Bukhoriy, the prophet (s.a.w) was reported saying: <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">"Month (lunar months) consist of twenty-nine days. So, do not fast till you have sighted it (the new moon) and if the sky is cloudy for you, then complete the counting to be thirty [i.e thity night (30 night)]". </span> </p>
          <p class="text-justify"> Having proved and established the sighting of the moon as a condition for the commencement of Romadon, it will be inadequate, not discussing some other related components: </p>
          
          <h5 class="text-uppercase text-info text-justify mt-3 mb-0">¶ How do we sight the new moon? Is it by weather forecast or showing of the Cresent?</h5>
          <p class="text-justify"> It should be known that, in Islaam, new months are generally determined by the appearance of hilaal (cresent, new moon) and nothing else. This is supported by an hadiith of the prophet: <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">"Verily, we are an unlettered nation; we neither write, nor do we forecast. The month is like this and this, i.e. sometimes of 29 days and sometimes of thirty days." (Reported by Bukoriyy, Muslim and others) </span>. </p>
          <p class="text-justify">     There is no difference of opinion regarding the sighting of the moon as the only means not until the time of the contemporary scholars and jurists. Some of them accepted and allowed, without jettisoning the sayings of the prophet, the use of weather forecast in determining the new moon otherwise called, "the cresent". </p> 
          
          <h5 class="h5 text-uppercase text-justify text-info mt-2">¶ Who confirm the sighting of the moon? </h5>
          <p class="text-justify mb-0">The question as to who confirm the sighting of the moon is very much pertinent to be discussed here. The question, whose witness is to be relied upon as to sighting of the cresent, is summarily provided below:
          </p>
          <ul class="font-italic ml-4 text-justify">
            <li class="">that the person(s) whose witness is to be relied upon should be of trustworthy person(s) not depending on the gender, i.e be it a male or female. </li>
            <li class="">that 'two eye witnesses' would be required for the confirmation of the appearance of Shawwal's new moon. </li>
            <li class=""> However, some scholars like Abuu Thawr ibn Hazm and others argued on the admissibility of only one eye witness. </li>
            <li class=""> To make it clearer, the author of sohiih fiq-hus-sunnah, relying on a saying of the prophet argued against the opinion of Abuu Thawr and others allowing only an eye witness account for the confirmation of the sighting of the new moon of Shawwal (terminating the continuation of Romadon fast). </li>
            <li class="">The hadiith provides thus: <span class="">"...and if two witnesses testify, then fast and stop fasting." (Reported by Nasaaii and Ahmad) </span> </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h5 class="h5 text-uppercase text-center mt-2">2. Completion of Sha`baan:</h5>
         <p class="text-justify">Following from the saying of the prophet on the sighting of the moon as the condition influencing the commencement of Romadon, completion of the counting of Sha`baan is the second and last solution provided the new moon or the cresent fails to show up. Also, it has been stated that the lunar months do not, by nature, count below 29 days but not exceeding 30 days. </p>
         <p class="text-justify mb-0">    The 30th day of the month preceding Romadon is regarded as "yawmu shakk (the uncertain day or day of uncertainty)". And there are divergent opinions regarding fasting on  this day. These are thus briefly highlighted below:</p>
         <ul class="font-italic ml-4 text-justify">
           <li class="">That to fast therein - be it compulsory or voluntary - is not allowed. </li>
           <li class="">That to fast on this day is waajib (Compulsory).</li>
           <li class="">That people should follow their Imaam (i.e the Muslim leader of that geographical location).</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="text-justify">   However, the consensus view is that, fasting on this day should be 'avoided'. </p>

          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase mt-4">introduction:</h3>
          <p class="text-justify ">Having established, in the first series, what constitutes fasting in Islaam, the various classifications and types of fasting, and the importance of fasting, we therefore proceed to discussing, shortly, concisely and precisely, <b> the rulings, virtues, terms and components of Romadoon fast</b>.  </p>
          
          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase">the ruling:</h3>
          <p class="text-justify"> Ṣowmu Romadoon (fasting in the blessed month of Romadoon) is, undebatable, one of the pillars of the religion of islaam and even the fourth after zakaat (charity). </p>
          <p class="text-justify">Ṣowmu Romadoon is one which its observance is made compulsory on every able Muslim: who has reached the stage of puberty, free from any form of insanity and health challenges, and that he is muqiim (dweller of a given geographical location and not a traveller). </p>
          <p class="text-justify">Two selected from among the numerous evidences stating its compulsoriness are given below: </p>
          <p class="text-justify mb-0"> • First is the evidence from the Qur-aan, Q2 vs 183 (Al-Baqoroh): </p>
          <p class="text-center font-italic ">"O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous". 
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify mb-0"> • The other one is a saying of the prophet of islaam (may the peace of Allaah be upon him) as it was reported by Bukhoriy: </p> 
          <p class="text-center font-italic">"Islaam is you worshipping Allaah and not associating partner with him, observing solaat, paying the compulsory zakaah (charity), and fasting in the month of Romadoon...".
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase">the virtues:</h3>
          <p class="text-justify mb-1"> Talking about the virtues of Romadoon. It should be understood that the month of Romadoon, the ninth month, is the best of all months. Below are some of the virtues of the month: </p>
          <ol class="ml-4 font-italic text-justify">
            <li class="">All acts of righteousness are rewarded in manifolds.</li>
            <li class="">During this period, the doors of hell are closed and while the gates leading to paradise are widely opened.</li>
            <li class=""> The devil and his cohorts are as well chained. </li>
            <li class="">For he who fasts during this period, and with the undiluted intent of attaining piety and sincerity, his previous sin, except for kabaair (the major sins), will all be forgiven.   </li>
            <li class="">Also, in its last ten days lies the "best night" - a night better-off a thousand  of months in virtues.  </li>
          </ol>
          
          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase">terms and conditions:</h3>
         <p class="text-justify">The terms and conditions applying to the validity of Romadoon fast are of two things:</p>
         <p class="h5 text-uppercase text-center mt-2">A. Purification from impurities:</p>
          <p class="text-justify"> This is peculiar to the women of Islamic faith. It connotes purification from State of Hayd (mentrual circle) and Nifaas (blood that flows during the postpartum period).</p>
          
         <p class="h5 text-uppercase text-center mt-2">B. intention:</p>
          <p class="text-justify"> Fasting is said to be an act of worship; it must be accompanied with a sincere and specified intention (niyyah). For this condition to be met, each an individual intending to fast must specifically either on daily basis or on the first night of Romadoon make up his "intent" to fast.</p>
         <p class="text-justify font-italic"><b>NOTE:</b> As regards to the intention, it is to be made in the mind only and not in words.</p>
         
          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase">components of romadoon fast:</h3>
         <p class="text-justify">This refers to the do's and don'ts of fasting for it to be acceptable. It could also be discussed under two headings, viz:</p>
         
         <p class="h5 text-uppercase text-center mt-2">A. Pillarsof fasting:</p>
         <p class="text-justify">This includes the abstinence from all that (like eating, drinking, intercourse, being unconscious, and so on) which could invalidate one's fast from the dawn till the sunset. This is much explained in Q2 vs 187.</p>
         
         <p class="h5 text-uppercase text-center mt-2">B. recommended acts:</p>
         <p class="text-justify">As opposed to the first components which, if done, invalidates the  fast, this includes: taking the pre-dawn meal (sahuur) and taking it at the last hour; hastening in breaking the fast (at its due time); praying before having the fast breaking; charity, recitation of Qur-aan and teaching it; guarding the tongue from irritative and unrighteous talk, and parting away from the peace-disturber. .</p>
         <p class="text-justify">However, if any of this is omitted, the fast is still intact. </p>

          <p class="text-justify"> By waajib, in Islamic jurisprudence, we mean those acts which are compulsory on each an individual and which is punishable upon neglect. So therefore, Ṣawmun waajib (compulsory fast or fasting) is that kind of sowm which is compulsory for each an individual to observe, and which upon neglect or disregard, the omitter is punishable. Simply put, it comprises those kinds of fasts which each and every individual Muslims is under obligation to observe.</p>
         <p class="text-justify">This is further classified into some sub-classications:</p>
         <ul class="text-justify ml-4 text-italize">
           <li class=""><b>That which is obligatory for a specific period of time: </b> this include only Ṣowm Romadoon (Ramadan fast)  which lasts for either 29 or 30 days throughout the month of Romadoon. </li>
           <li class=""><b>That which is obligatory for a cause or flaw: </b> this is quite known as Ṣowmul-Kaffaaroh (atonement or expiation fast).</li>
           <li class=""> <b>That which is obligatory by way of making a vow: </b> that is, a self-obligatory. This is called Ṣowmun-Nadh-r. </li>
         </ul>
         
         <p class="h5 text-uppercase mt-2 text-center"> 2. at-tatow-wu`u (voluntary) </p>
          <p class="text-justify">This means, as opposed to al-waajib, non-obligatory. And each an individual is under discretion to fast or not. This further includes: </p>
          <ul class="text-justify ml-4">
            <li class=""> <b> Sittatu Shaw-waal: </b> the six fast in the month of Shaw-waal after the completion of Romadoon. </li>
            <li class=""> <b> Taasuu-`aa wa `aashuuroo: </b> the fast in the ninth and tenth month of Shaw-waal.</li>
            <li class=""> <b>Ṣowmu shah-ru Sha`baan: </b> fasting in the month of Sha`baan.</li>
            <li class=""> <b>Ṣowmu yawmul-`arofah: </b>fasting on the day of `Arofah (a day preceding the tenth day of Dhul-hijjah</li>
            <li class=""><b> Ṣowmul-Khomiis walith-nayn:</b> fasting on the every Monday and Thursday of the week</li>
            <li class=""> <b>Ṣowmu ayyaamul-biid: </b>fasting on 13th, 14th or 15th day of every Islamic month. </li>
            <li class=""> <b>Ṣowmu ayyaamul-biid: </b> fasting on 13th, 14th or 15th day of every Islamic month. </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase">importance:</h3>
          <p class="text-justify mb-0">The importance of fasting cannot be overemphasized. Thus, below are few: </p>
          <p class="text-justify mb-0">1. Fasting is form of Obedience to Allaah, and by it: </p>
          <ul class="text-justify ml-4">
            <li class=""> Man moves closer to his Lord. </li>
            <li class="">a devoter is rewarded without a set limitation.</li>
            <li class=""> forgiveness of previous sins is guaranteed</li>
            <li class=""> protection against hell fire.</li>
            <li class="">assurance of Jannah (paradise) through the special made door for those who fast</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p class="text-justify mb-0"> 2. Fasting is like a Special Moral School to the believers as it instill in them:</p>
          <ul class="text-justify ml-4">
            <li class="">  attainment of perfect moral character. </li>
            <li class="">Self-jihad (self-sacrifice). </li>
            <li class=""> leniency to one another. </li>
            <li class="">  Perseverance  </li>
            <li class="">strengthening of Muslim brotherhood.</li>

        <div class="collapse mt-5 mx-2" id="collapseIslam1">
          <p class="text-dark text-justify">Tohaaroh, to simply put, means "purity or purification". It is considered as waajib, a must.  This is clearly stated in Q 74 vs 4 and an hadith that: "Purity is half of faith".
          <p class="text-dark text-justify">In islaam, waajib is what is regarded as compulsory or mandatory. And as such, its omission attracts punishment.
          </p>
          <p class="text-dark text-justify">Categorically, it is categorised into two: Zoohirah and Baatinah (outerpart and innerpart purification). 
          </p>
          <p class="text-dark text-justify">The baatinah is the purity of  nafs (the heart, mind) from sins and dis-obedience. And it is done by wat is called "REPENTANCE". Also, purifying the soul from shirk (associating partner with Allah), enviness and all other which are regarded as impure acts. 
           </p>
          <p class="text-dark text-justify">Allaah said in Q 91 vs 9 & 10 (Ash-shams): <br>
          <i style="text-align: center;" class="text-center"> "He has succeeded who purifies it." <br>
          "And he has failed who instills it [with corruption]." </i>
          </p>
          <p class="text-dark text-justify">Zoohiroh, outerpart purification, on the other side, is also divided into two sub-branches: <b> al-khubth and al-hadath </b>.
           </p>
          <p class="text-dark text-justify">The khabath which is regarded as purity from offensive condition  is associated with the removal of impurity from cloth, human body and place of prayer with "CLEAN WATER" only or any of its substitutes.
          </p>
          <p class="text-dark text-justify">And the second sub-branch which is AL-HADATH involves either of wuduu (water ablution), ghusl (spiritual bath) and tayammun (dry or sand ablution). It is called ritual purification. Q 5 vs 6 (Al-maaidah) is instructive here. It says: <i> "O you who have believed, when you rise to [perform] prayer, wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over your heads and wash your feet to the ankles. And if you are in a state of janabah, then purify yourselves. But if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women and do not find water, then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and hands with it..." </i>
