          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase mt-4">introduction:</h3>
          <p class="text-justify ">The topic, "with what does the Romadon fast become compulsory", could best understood as, determinants or considerable factors that influence the fasting period in the month of Romadon. </p>
          <p class="text-justify ">As such, this write-up will briefly and summarily  address those factors responsible for determining 'when and way' to commence fasting in the blessed month. </p>
          
          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase">FACTORS INFLUENCING ROMADON FAST:</h3>
          <p class="text-justify"> According to the author of Sohiih Fiq-hus-sunnah, 'sighting of the moon' is the only the factor influencing fasting period in Romadon. By sighting of the moon, it is meant that, seeing or witnessing the new moon of the month of Romadon. </p>
          <p class="text-justify mb-0">  The commencement of the month of Romadon could be determined via any of these two ways: </p>
          <ol class="ml-4 text-justify mb-1">
            <li class="">Seeing the new cresent, and </li>
            <li class="">Completion of Sha`ban.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="text-justify">These two highlighted factors shall be further discussed as below: </p>
          <h5 class="h5 text-uppercase text-left mt-2">1. Seeing the New Cresent:</h5>
          <p class="text-justify"> This is saying that, before the commencement of Romadon can be declared or determined, the new moon of Romadon must be sighted. This is predicated on the saying of Allah: <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold"> "...So, whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it;..." (Al-Baqorah 2:185) </span> </p>
          <p class="text-justify"> Also, going by the sayings of the prophet, in the book of Bukhoriy, the prophet (s.a.w) was reported saying: <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">"Month (lunar months) consist of twenty-nine days. So, do not fast till you have sighted it (the new moon) and if the sky is cloudy for you, then complete the counting to be thirty [i.e thity night (30 night)]". </span> </p>
          <p class="text-justify"> Having proved and established the sighting of the moon as a condition for the commencement of Romadon, it will be inadequate, not discussing some other related components: </p>
          
          <h5 class="text-uppercase text-info text-justify mt-3 mb-0">¶ How do we sight the new moon? Is it by weather forecast or showing of the Cresent?</h5>
          <p class="text-justify"> It should be known that, in Islaam, new months are generally determined by the appearance of hilaal (cresent, new moon) and nothing else. This is supported by an hadiith of the prophet: <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">"Verily, we are an unlettered nation; we neither write, nor do we forecast. The month is like this and this, i.e. sometimes of 29 days and sometimes of thirty days." (Reported by Bukoriyy, Muslim and others) </span>. </p>
          <p class="text-justify">     There is no difference of opinion regarding the sighting of the moon as the only means not until the time of the contemporary scholars and jurists. Some of them accepted and allowed, without jettisoning the sayings of the prophet, the use of weather forecast in determining the new moon otherwise called, "the cresent". </p> 
          
          <h5 class="h5 text-uppercase text-justify text-info mt-2">¶ Who confirm the sighting of the moon? </h5>
          <p class="text-justify mb-0">The question as to who confirm the sighting of the moon is very much pertinent to be discussed here. The question, whose witness is to be relied upon as to sighting of the cresent, is summarily provided below:
          </p>
          <ul class="font-italic ml-4 text-justify">
            <li class="">that the person(s) whose witness is to be relied upon should be of trustworthy person(s) not depending on the gender, i.e be it a male or female. </li>
            <li class="">that 'two eye witnesses' would be required for the confirmation of the appearance of Shawwal's new moon. </li>
            <li class=""> However, some scholars like Abuu Thawr ibn Hazm and others argued on the admissibility of only one eye witness. </li>
            <li class=""> To make it clearer, the author of sohiih fiq-hus-sunnah, relying on a saying of the prophet argued against the opinion of Abuu Thawr and others allowing only an eye witness account for the confirmation of the sighting of the new moon of Shawwal (terminating the continuation of Romadon fast). </li>
            <li class="">The hadiith provides thus: <span class="">"...and if two witnesses testify, then fast and stop fasting." (Reported by Nasaaii and Ahmad) </span> </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h5 class="h5 text-uppercase text-center mt-2">2. Completion of Sha`baan:</h5>
         <p class="text-justify">Following from the saying of the prophet on the sighting of the moon as the condition influencing the commencement of Romadon, completion of the counting of Sha`baan is the second and last solution provided the new moon or the cresent fails to show up. Also, it has been stated that the lunar months do not, by nature, count below 29 days but not exceeding 30 days. </p>
         <p class="text-justify mb-0">    The 30th day of the month preceding Romadon is regarded as "yawmu shakk (the uncertain day or day of uncertainty)". And there are divergent opinions regarding fasting on  this day. These are thus briefly highlighted below:</p>
         <ul class="font-italic ml-4 text-justify">
           <li class="">That to fast therein - be it compulsory or voluntary - is not allowed. </li>
           <li class="">That to fast on this day is waajib (Compulsory).</li>
           <li class="">That people should follow their Imaam (i.e the Muslim leader of that geographical location).</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="text-justify">   However, the consensus view is that, fasting on this day should be 'avoided'. </p>

          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase mt-4">introduction:</h3>
          <p class="text-justify ">Having established, in the first series, what constitutes fasting in Islaam, the various classifications and types of fasting, and the importance of fasting, we therefore proceed to discussing, shortly, concisely and precisely, <b> the rulings, virtues, terms and components of Romadoon fast</b>.  </p>
          
          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase">the ruling:</h3>
          <p class="text-justify"> Ṣowmu Romadoon (fasting in the blessed month of Romadoon) is, undebatable, one of the pillars of the religion of islaam and even the fourth after zakaat (charity). </p>
          <p class="text-justify">Ṣowmu Romadoon is one which its observance is made compulsory on every able Muslim: who has reached the stage of puberty, free from any form of insanity and health challenges, and that he is muqiim (dweller of a given geographical location and not a traveller). </p>
          <p class="text-justify">Two selected from among the numerous evidences stating its compulsoriness are given below: </p>
          <p class="text-justify mb-0"> • First is the evidence from the Qur-aan, Q2 vs 183 (Al-Baqoroh): </p>
          <p class="text-center font-italic ">"O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous". 
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify mb-0"> • The other one is a saying of the prophet of islaam (may the peace of Allaah be upon him) as it was reported by Bukhoriy: </p> 
          <p class="text-center font-italic">"Islaam is you worshipping Allaah and not associating partner with him, observing solaat, paying the compulsory zakaah (charity), and fasting in the month of Romadoon...".
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase">the virtues:</h3>
          <p class="text-justify mb-1"> Talking about the virtues of Romadoon. It should be understood that the month of Romadoon, the ninth month, is the best of all months. Below are some of the virtues of the month: </p>
          <ol class="ml-4 font-italic text-justify">
            <li class="">All acts of righteousness are rewarded in manifolds.</li>
            <li class="">During this period, the doors of hell are closed and while the gates leading to paradise are widely opened.</li>
            <li class=""> The devil and his cohorts are as well chained. </li>
            <li class="">For he who fasts during this period, and with the undiluted intent of attaining piety and sincerity, his previous sin, except for kabaair (the major sins), will all be forgiven.   </li>
            <li class="">Also, in its last ten days lies the "best night" - a night better-off a thousand  of months in virtues.  </li>
          </ol>
          
          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase">terms and conditions:</h3>
         <p class="text-justify">The terms and conditions applying to the validity of Romadoon fast are of two things:</p>
         <p class="h5 text-uppercase text-center mt-2">A. Purification from impurities:</p>
          <p class="text-justify"> This is peculiar to the women of Islamic faith. It connotes purification from State of Hayd (mentrual circle) and Nifaas (blood that flows during the postpartum period).</p>
          
         <p class="h5 text-uppercase text-center mt-2">B. intention:</p>
          <p class="text-justify"> Fasting is said to be an act of worship; it must be accompanied with a sincere and specified intention (niyyah). For this condition to be met, each an individual intending to fast must specifically either on daily basis or on the first night of Romadoon make up his "intent" to fast.</p>
         <p class="text-justify font-italic"><b>NOTE:</b> As regards to the intention, it is to be made in the mind only and not in words.</p>
         
          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase">components of romadoon fast:</h3>
         <p class="text-justify">This refers to the do's and don'ts of fasting for it to be acceptable. It could also be discussed under two headings, viz:</p>
         
         <p class="h5 text-uppercase text-center mt-2">A. Pillarsof fasting:</p>
         <p class="text-justify">This includes the abstinence from all that (like eating, drinking, intercourse, being unconscious, and so on) which could invalidate one's fast from the dawn till the sunset. This is much explained in Q2 vs 187.</p>
         
         <p class="h5 text-uppercase text-center mt-2">B. recommended acts:</p>
         <p class="text-justify">As opposed to the first components which, if done, invalidates the  fast, this includes: taking the pre-dawn meal (sahuur) and taking it at the last hour; hastening in breaking the fast (at its due time); praying before having the fast breaking; charity, recitation of Qur-aan and teaching it; guarding the tongue from irritative and unrighteous talk, and parting away from the peace-disturber. .</p>
         <p class="text-justify">However, if any of this is omitted, the fast is still intact. </p>

          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase mt-4">introduction:</h3>
          <p class="text-justify ">This writing explains, although very brief but concise, what ṣowm (fasting) means in the religion of islaam, the various classifications of ṣowm in islaamic religion and essence of fasting. </p>
          
          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase">meaning:</h3>
          <p class="text-justify"> Ṣowm, otherwise called Siyaam, is an Arabic word which linguistically means: alim-tisaak (abstinence) and al-kaff (discontinuance). </p>
          <p class="text-justify">And while, in technical sense (according to the understanding of the sharii-`ah), ṣowm or ṣiyaam is that act of abstaining and discontinuance with all that, which can invalidate our fast starting from the appearance of al-fajr (dawn, before day break) till the setting of the sun (ghuruubish-sham-s) and which is accompanied with the intent of worshipping Allaah, the Most High. </p>
          
          <h3 class="h5 text-danger text-uppercase">classifications:</h3>
          <p class="text-justify mb-1"> According to the author of Sohiihu fiq-hus-sunnah (rohimahul-laah), there are basically two (2) classifications of sowm: </p>
         <p class="h5 text-uppercase mt-2 text-center"> 1. al-waajib (obligatory) </p>

          <p class="text-justify"> By waajib, in Islamic jurisprudence, we mean those acts which are compulsory on each an individual and which is punishable upon neglect. So therefore, Ṣawmun waajib (compulsory fast or fasting) is that kind of sowm which is compulsory for each an individual to observe, and which upon neglect or disregard, the omitter is punishable. Simply put, it comprises those kinds of fasts which each and every individual Muslims is under obligation to observe.</p>
         <p class="text-justify">This is further classified into some sub-classications:</p>
         <ul class="text-justify ml-4 text-italize">
           <li class=""><b>That which is obligatory for a specific period of time: </b> this include only Ṣowm Romadoon (Ramadan fast)  which lasts for either 29 or 30 days throughout the month of Romadoon. </li>
           <li class=""><b>That which is obligatory for a cause or flaw: </b> this is quite known as Ṣowmul-Kaffaaroh (atonement or expiation fast).</li>
           <li class=""> <b>That which is obligatory by way of making a vow: </b> that is, a self-obligatory. This is called Ṣowmun-Nadh-r. </li>
         </ul>
         
         <p class="h5 text-uppercase mt-2 text-center"> 2. at-tatow-wu`u (voluntary) </p>
          <p class="text-justify">This means, as opposed to al-waajib, non-obligatory. And each an individual is under discretion to fast or not. This further includes: </p>
          <ul class="text-justify ml-4">
            <li class=""> <b> Sittatu Shaw-waal: </b> the six fast in the month of Shaw-waal after the completion of Romadoon. </li>
            <li class=""> <b> Taasuu-`aa wa `aashuuroo: </b> the fast in the ninth and tenth month of Shaw-waal.</li>
            <li class=""> <b>Ṣowmu shah-ru Sha`baan: </b> fasting in the month of Sha`baan.</li>
            <li class=""> <b>Ṣowmu yawmul-`arofah: </b>fasting on the day of `Arofah (a day preceding the tenth day of Dhul-hijjah</li>
            <li class=""><b> Ṣowmul-Khomiis walith-nayn:</b> fasting on the every Monday and Thursday of the week</li>
            <li class=""> <b>Ṣowmu ayyaamul-biid: </b>fasting on 13th, 14th or 15th day of every Islamic month. </li>

        <div class="collapse mt-2 mx-2" id="collapseIslam1">
          <p class="text-dark text-justify">Tohaaroh, to simply put, means "purity or purification". It is considered as waajib, a must.  This is clearly stated in Q 74 vs 4 and an hadith that: "Purity is half of faith".
          <p class="text-dark text-justify">In islaam, waajib is what is regarded as compulsory or mandatory. And as such, its omission attracts punishment.
          </p>
          <p class="text-dark text-justify">Categorically, it is categorised into two: Zoohirah and Baatinah (outerpart and innerpart purification). 
          </p>
          <p class="text-dark text-justify">The baatinah is the purity of  nafs (the heart, mind) from sins and dis-obedience. And it is done by wat is called "REPENTANCE". Also, purifying the soul from shirk (associating partner with Allah), enviness and all other which are regarded as impure acts. 
           </p>
          <p class="text-dark text-justify">Allaah said in Q 91 vs 9 & 10 (Ash-shams): <br>
          <i style="text-align: center;" class="text-center"> "He has succeeded who purifies it." <br>
          "And he has failed who instills it [with corruption]." </i>
          </p>
          <p class="text-dark text-justify">Zoohiroh, outerpart purification, on the other side, is also divided into two sub-branches: <b> al-khubth and al-hadath </b>.
           </p>
          <p class="text-dark text-justify">The khabath which is regarded as purity from offensive condition  is associated with the removal of impurity from cloth, human body and place of prayer with "CLEAN WATER" only or any of its substitutes.
          </p>
          <p class="text-dark text-justify">And the second sub-branch which is AL-HADATH involves either of wuduu (water ablution), ghusl (spiritual bath) and tayammun (dry or sand ablution). It is called ritual purification. Q 5 vs 6 (Al-maaidah) is instructive here. It says: <i> "O you who have believed, when you rise to [perform] prayer, wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over your heads and wash your feet to the ankles. And if you are in a state of janabah, then purify yourselves. But if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women and do not find water, then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and hands with it..." </i>
