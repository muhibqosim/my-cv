         <p class=""> Prophet Ibrahim (A.S) was given birth to by Aazar (his father as confirmed in Q6 vs 74) and Amiilah (his mother).	His first wife was Saarroh, while his second wife was Haajara.¬†</p>
       </article>
       
       <article class="text-dark text-justify "> 
         <p> The people of Ibrahim, except him and his wife, used to worship things like heavenly bodies (stars, moon, and sun), idols, and some great heroes during their time by having their sculptures. However, by Allaah's grace, the prophet Ibrahim was guided by Allah right from his childhood. </p>
       </article>
       <article class="text-dark text-justify ">
         <p> The first person Prophet Ibrahim preached to not to engage in the worship of anything else besides Allaah was his father. He (A.S) warned him with respect not to worship things that could neither help nor harm him. He let his father know that he (Ibrahim) had been given special guidance from the only Noble Lord. But, unfortunately, his father never heeded his preaching. </p>
       </article>
       <article class="text-dark text-justify ">
         <p> Part of Allaah's guidance on Prophet Ibrahim was that there was this one night when he meditated on the uniqueness and genuineness of what his people used to worship besides the only Lord. He contemplated the nature of the stars, moon, and sun that his people used to worship and discovered that these objects were nothing more than deception and false gods. The Qur-aan states: 
              <p class="px-5"> ‚ÄúAnd thus did We show Abraham the realm of the heavens and the earth that he would be among the certain [in faith]...‚Äù ~ Al-An'am 6: 75 ‚Äî 83 </p>
        </p>
       </article>
       
       <article class="text-dark text-justify ">
         <p> There was a great day when Prophet Ibrahim did something very amazing. On the day of his people's annual festival, usually held on the outskirts of the city, he went to the temple his people designated for their idols and used an axe to break the idols, leaving the axe hung around the biggest of them untampered. The rationale behind what Prophet Ibrahim did was to challenge his people intellectually. However, they could not see any light in the challenge. All that they did was to blame themselves for not having someone who was supposed to have stayed behind to watch their idols till they returned from their outskirt shrine.¬†</p>
       </article>
       
       <article class="text-dark text-justify ">
         <p> Thereafter, they ordered his arrest and then threw him in a blazing fire. But, Allaah instructed the set ablaze fire to be a safe place for Ibrahim by saying "kuunii bardan wasalaaman `alaa Ibrahim" (translated as:... Be a coolness and safety to Ibrahim). </p>
       </article>
     
       <article class="text-dark text-justify ">
         <p> Another very amazing event was the logical dialogue between him and Namruudh, who claimed to be God. After several debates, Prophet Ibrahim thereafter challenged Namruudh to command the sun to appear from where it was supposed to set, but he was unable to do that.
         </p>
       </article>
       
       <article class="text-dark text-justify ">
         <p> Prophet Ibrahim's second wife, Haajara, gave birth to Ismaa`iil (Ishmail), who was the first child of Prophet Ibrahim (A.S). He was born when Prophet Ibrahim was 86 years old. Some years later, about 13 years, his first wife, Saarroh, also gave birth to Is-haaq (Isac), the second child.</p>
       </article>
       <article class="text-dark text-justify ">
         <p>However, one of the greatest tests was Allaah's instruction to the prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice his first son, Ismaa`iil. Prophet Ibrahim never made any promises, as some people used to say (to read more, you can check As-soof-faat vs. 98‚Äì113, Q37). With strong faith in Allaah despite that he gave birth to the child he was instructed to sacrifice at his old age of 86 years, he swiftly informed his child, Ismaa`iil and Haajara, his second wife and mother of Ismaa`iil about the divine commandment.
         </p>
       </article>
       <article class="text-dark text-justify ">
         <p> With strong faith, none of them (both the Mother and the child) ever say a negative word. They rather submitted and subjected themselves to the will of the Most High. As Prophet Ibrahim and his family (Isma`il and his mother, Haajara) moved towards the outskirts of Makkah, and after laying down Isma`il (covering his face) in order to do as instructed, Angel Jibriil appeared to him with a "white sound-looking ram" from Jannah. </p>
       </article>
      
       <article class="text-dark text-justify ">
         <p class=""> In short, Allaah substituted the sacrifice of Isma`il with the "white sound and good-looking ram". Hence, how we all do during the Ileya festival (`iidul-ad-haa; festival of sacrifice). 
         </p>
       </article>
       
       <article class="text-dark text-justify ">
         <p class=""> Similarly, after the event, Allah directed Prophet Ibrahim and Isma`il, the first sons, to construct the site now known as al-Ka`bah. The true narration is that, there had not been any erection or foundation before the instruction came. The location is centred on the baytul-ma`muur (the frequented house) in the heavens where the angels used to worship Allaah. There is a prophetic tradition that says the house like al-ka`bah in heaven used to have one thousand different angels worshipping there daily. Allaahu akbar. Hence, the annual visit to Ka`bah in Makkah.
