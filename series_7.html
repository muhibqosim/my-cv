       <article class="text-dark text-justify text-uppercase font-weight-bold h4"> introduction</article>
          <p class="text-justify ">Coming to the end of "few days to Romadon series" and being the seventh one, we shall be discussing another important aspect to know about fasting in islaam. </p>
          <p class="text-justify ">As couched in the topic, the Islamic ruling regulating the payment of Romadoon missed fast are built on some certain number of principles. Thus, this writing shall discuss the various Islamic rulings on making up of Romadoon missed fast - when and how. </p>
          
          <h3 class="h4 text-dark text-uppercase mt-4"> PAYING BACK THE MISSED FAST</h3>
          <p class="text-justify"> This applies to those who are allowed to skip fasting in the month of Romadon as it was fully covered in the series 6 of few days to Romadon. The islamic ruling guiding the make up of the missed fast are thus discussed below: </p>
          
          <h5 class="h6 text-center text-uppercase "> <span class="text-info text-capitalize h5">principle one:</span> <br /> He who skips his fast or have it break without having a genuine reason have to make it up </h5>
          <p class="text-justify"> Although, scholars are of two opinions in this regards, the strong opinion is that, only the missed days should be paid back only and nothing else.  </p>
          
          <h5 class="h6 text-center text-uppercase "> <span class="text-info text-capitalize h5">principle two:</span> <br /> It is not a mandate to make up the missed days immediately after the Romadon fasting period </h5>
          <p class="text-justify"> That is, he who have his fast break, without any legal justification, is not under force to have the make-up immediately after the completion of Romadon. He has the freewill to determine when  to have it paid back.</p>
          
          <h5 class="h6 text-center text-uppercase "> <span class="text-info text-capitalize h5">principle three:</span> <br /> Persons under obligation to have the Romadon missed fast paid back are not compelled to do that successively</h5>
          <p class="text-justify"> Somehow related to principle two discussed above, this principle is making it clear that no one is under compel to have the missed fast paid back consecutively without break; it is by discretion. Thus, the clear distinction between  the second principle and third principle is that while the former is as to "when" to have them paid back, the later is as to "how" they should be mad.</p>
          
          <h5 class="h6 text-center text-uppercase "> <span class="text-info text-capitalize h5">principle four:</span> <br /> Making up the missed fast of a decease.</h5>
          <p class="text-justify mb-0"> Whether it is right or not to fast on behalf of a deceased person, there are three scholarly opinions regarding the permissibility or otherwise. They are: </p>
          
          <p class="text-justify font-italic mx-2 mb-0"> a. That no fast should be made on behalf of a deceased person, be it the decease missed Romadoon fast or his self-obligatory by way of vow (nadh-r), which he had made before death overpowered him. </p>
          <p class="text-justify font-italic mx-2 mb-0">b. That it is legal, right and required to fast on behalf of a decease person be it missed Romadoon fast or self-obligatory by way of vow (nadh-r). </p>
          <p class="text-justify font-italic mx-2 ">c. That only the 'self-obligatory fast' should be made on behalf of the decease and not the missed Romadon fast. </p>
           <p class="text-justify "> It should be noted that each of these opinions are backed with relevant authorities. However, the author of sohiih fiq-hus-sunnah  adopted and stood by the opinion of the second group of scholars who were of the opinion that both the missed fast of Romadon and that of vow should be made on behalf of the deceased. </p>
           
           <p class="text-justify text-secondary"> Meanwhile, there are still some conditions that influence such a permission, viz: </p>
          <p class="text-justify font-italic mx-2 ">1. Where it is proved that  the decease, when he was alive, lacked the capacity and ability to make up his fast be it Romadon or Self-obligatory fast, his relative and heirs are not mandated to far on behalf of him nor are they compelled to feed sixty poor persons or to have a slave freed. </p>
          <p class="text-justify font-italic mx-2 ">2. Where it is proved that  the decease, when he was alive, lacked the capacity and ability to make up his fast be it Romadon or Self-obligatory fast, his relative and heirs are not mandated to far on behalf of him nor are they compelled to feed sixty poor persons or to have a slave freed. </p>
          <p class="text-justify font-italic mx-2 ">3. And if he died having an outstanding Self-obligatory fast, it should be made on behalf of him. . </p>
